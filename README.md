# JS Cover Flow - Touchless w/ Gestures.IO
We remixed JS Cover Flow by @luwes to add gesture-based interaction to it (basic swipes from left or right hand).

Compatible with Kinect, RealSense, OpenNI, and the list is growing...

Will be enhanced during the current beta. All info: https://gestures.io
